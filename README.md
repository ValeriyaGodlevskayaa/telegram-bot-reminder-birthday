# Telegram Bot Reminder Birthday

## Description
> This chatbot helps users view their contacts, add new entries, and receive birthday notifications. 

## Test Task Description
```
Install Node-red
https://nodered.org/
Install postgres
https://www.postgresql.org/

Create a bot in telegram using this software that uses the telegram REST API
https://core.telegram.org/bots/api

For example:
A bot that registers users and allows them to save contacts and their birthdays. You can ask for the birthday of someone whom the user has saved, or get a list of everyone saved there.

What we want to see is an understanding of
- how to work with the REST API (i.e., we don't use a node special for Telegram)
- anatomy of HTTP requests and their different types
- working with the database (https://dbdiagram.io/home)
```

## Features:
    - View contacts
    - Add new contacts
    - Delete contact 
    - Search by name
    - Notifications about birthdays

## Libraries & Tools Used:
    - Node.js: v20.10.0
    - npm: 10.9.2
    - ngrok - for local testing of webhooks.
